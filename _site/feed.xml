        <title>finding home</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt; In my twenty-and-some years, I've called California, Connecticut, and Hong Kong my home. I've spent summers in New York, D.C., and Beijing. This sort of itineracy creates certain habits: when a person knows that at the end of x weeks, everything must come off the walls and into as few boxes as possible to be shipped off to the next location, her conception of home changes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; What exactly makes a place &quot;home&quot;? Knowing how to walk through your house in pitch darkness, how to finagle the radiator knob, or how to take the fastest route to your favorite coffee shop to shave thirty seconds off your travel time? Is it finding that one person who will bake an apple pie with you on a Thursday midnight, having people around who call out your faults to help you grow, even when it hurts? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; For me, it's been all of these things. But also a lot more. I'm still trying to put together the pieces, but one thing I know for certain is that home isn't confined to one static, physical space. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; I'll be living in Taipei for the next year, and I hope I'll be able to find home here. &lt;/p&gt;
