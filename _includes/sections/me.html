	<p> Hi, I'm Janice. I'm a recent Yale graduate (Ã she!) currently taking a gap year in Taipei.</p>

	<p> This blog will be an inconsistent and haphazardly-curated collection of my photos and thoughts over the next year. It might be mix of photo-dumping, travel-journaling, and thought-spewing. It will always be a work in progress. I'm not sure where this year will take me, but feel free to follow along! </p>
