	<p> Hi, I'm Janice. I'm a recent Yale graduate (Ã she!) currently taking a gap year in Taipei.</p>

	<p> This blog will be an inconsistently- and haphazardly-curated collection of my photographs and half-formed thoughts. It will always be a work in progress. I'm not sure where this year will take me, but feel free to follow along! </p>
